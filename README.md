## AI & Machine Learning Project

This repository houses the project I completed as part of the Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience Program. The program was focused on various facets of AI including Data Analysis, Data Modeling, Machine Learning, and Quality Assurance.

## Project Description

During the virtual experience program, I took on a series of tasks that deepened my understanding and skills in AI. The projects included:

1. **Task One: Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed customer data using Python and Google Colab, providing insights that guided subsequent modeling tasks.

2. **Task Two: Data Modeling**
   - Framed problem statements and developed a data modeling strategy using various techniques.

3. **Task Three: Model Building and Interpretation**
   - Built and interpreted predictive models that contributed to business decisions, and developed machine learning algorithms for production.

4. **Task Four: Quality Assurance**
   - Conducted quality assurance evaluations on machine learning models, ensuring improved model accuracy and robustness.



## Requirements

- Python
- Google Colab
